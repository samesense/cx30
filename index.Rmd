Hello, Website!

For more information about simple R Markdown websites, please read the documentation at https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html.

Please also note that simple R Markdown sites are _not_ based on **blogdown**. They are probably good for websites with only a few Rmd documents. For larger-scale and more sophisticated websites (such as blogs), you may want to use **blogdown** instead: https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown.

```{r echo=FALSE}
require(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
df <- read_tsv("cars.out.tsv", show_col_types = FALSE)
df |> 
  ggplot( aes(x=price, y=miles, colour=factor(year)) ) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw(base_size=18) +
  scale_color_discrete(name="") 
  
```
